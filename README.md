Bike Rental Prediction using XGBOOST 


Using Historical Data We are predicting the bikes rentals 
taking into considerations parameters such as company's growth and months seasons and other enviornmental factors like windspeed, tempearature etc...
Goal of this project is to make enough bikes avaliable for rental at a place, company wants to optimize the number of bikes avaliable for rental
it should not be in a suitation where there are customers but no bikes avaliable for rent and at the same time there are bikes but no customers for taking them.
